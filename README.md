An app for monitoring the state of a local blood bank so you can donate blood.

## Building

### With Gradle

The easiest way to build is to install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html) v1.+
with [Gradle](https://www.gradle.org/) v2.2.1.
Once installed, then you can import the project into Android Studio:

1. Open `File`
2. Import Project
3. Select `build.gradle` under the project directory
4. Click `OK`

Then, Gradle will do everything for you.
